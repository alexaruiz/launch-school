what do the following expressions evaluate to? That is, what value does each 
expression return?

1. x = 2
2. puts x = 2
3. p name = "Joe"
4. four = "four"
5. print something = "nothing"

Answers:

1. Here, the integer 2 is assigned to x. This expression will evaluate to 2.
2. Here we are assigning the integer 2 to x and printing the value 2 to the 
console with a new line; however, this expression will evaluate to nil as the 
method puts returns nil.
3. Puts returns nil, meanwhile p returns the object you pass to it and prints 
the raw form of whatever you pass to it to the console with a new line. Thus,
this expression will exiprint "Joe" to the console and also return the string Joe. 
4. The string "four" is assigned to four. This expression will evaluate to the 
string "four".
5. The string "nothing" is assigned to something and then printed to the console
with no new line. This expression will return nil.
