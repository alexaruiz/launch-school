what is exception handling, and what problem does it solve?

excepion handling allows the code to continue executing when an error is 
encountered (due to unexpected/bad input or other reasons), otherwise the program
would stop as soon as it would encounter the error and the rest of the
program would never be executed. It is a way of "rescuing" your program.
