# Launch School

Launch School is an online, self-paced, mastery-based school founded by experienced software engineers and focused on teaching the core fundamentals of software development. 
Students can choose between two tracks: a **Ruby** track and a **JavaScript** track.

* In the **Ruby** track, programming fundamentals are taught with Ruby first. Students then move on to backend web development, where a Ruby framework called Sinatra is used, along with a templating language called ERB. When students get to the frontend part of the curriculum, the curriculum shifts to using JavaScript.

* In the JavaScript track, JavaScript is taught exclusively, both for backend and frontend development. The Express framework with Node.js is used for backend web development, along with the Pug templating language.

This repository hosts all of the information and exercises as I work through the Ruby (backend) and JavaScript (frontend) courses within the Launch School curriculum.
